# Endorse-O-Matic
Welcome to the Endorse-O-Matic a tool to simplify the LinkedIn endorsing proccess. EOM uses the selenium-webdriver to simulate real interaction with linkedin. 
## Usage
1. clone this repository 
2. bundle 
3. run ``ruby lib/linked.rb`` 
4. The program will prompt you for your LinkedIn credentials (don't worry nothing is saved)
5. You will be prompted whether you would like to send connect invites to users you are not yet connected with
6. Sit back and enjoy as the EOM goes to work!

If you are getting errors make sure you have installed the latest version of chrome.
If you are on a slow internet connection you may have to adjust the timeout interval on line 81
